Modifications to add more variety to piece shapes varying the size of each nub and wiggling around the intersections to further warp the edges.

Very useful tool for debugging:

(the save function is pieced together based on a bunch of answers of this stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19327749/javascript-blob-filename-without-link, that
should make that part cc-by-sa - unless the posters there didn't have the rights to post it)

if you want to give credit, a link to this repo is fine, but in no way required
